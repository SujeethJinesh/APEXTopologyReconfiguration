# Milestone M0 â€” F0.1 Scaffold (Repo + Tooling)

**What**: Create minimal Python package scaffold with interfaces, a mutable Message dataclass, dev tooling (pytest/ruff/black/isort/pre-commit), and Makefile.

**How**: PEP 621 pyproject.toml with dev extras, Makefile targets (lint, fmt, test), .pre-commit-config.yaml, skeleton packages under apex/, and minimal tests that validate structure.

**Why**: Establish a reproducible, testable baseline before implementing runtime features.

**Commands to reproduce**:
```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pre-commit install
make lint
make test
```

**DoD**:
- make lint passes
- make test passes

**Artifacts**: n/a for M0 (runtime eval artifacts appear in later milestones).
