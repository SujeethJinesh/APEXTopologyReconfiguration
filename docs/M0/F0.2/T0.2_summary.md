# Milestone M0 — F0.2 CI (GitHub Actions)

**What**: CI pipeline that runs lint and tests on push and PR; uploads artifacts/** if present.

**How**: .github/workflows/ci.yml uses Python 3.11, installs .[dev], runs make lint and make test, and uploads artifacts with if-no-files-found: ignore.

**Why**: Ensure repeatability and green‐CI signal from the start.

**Notes**: No runtime benchmarks or JSONL logs in M0.
