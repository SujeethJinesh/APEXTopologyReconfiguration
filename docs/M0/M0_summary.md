# Milestone M0 — Complete Summary

## What was implemented
Milestone M0 establishes the foundational scaffold for the APEX Framework, including:
- Complete Python package structure with proper namespacing
- Development tooling (pytest, black, ruff, isort, pre-commit)
- CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
- Protocol interfaces for runtime components
- Mutable Message dataclass with exact specified fields
- Configuration defaults for MVP
- Comprehensive test suite validating the scaffold

## How it was implemented
- **Package structure**: Used PEP 621 compliant `pyproject.toml` with setuptools backend
- **Code quality**: Configured black, ruff, and isort with consistent 100-char line length
- **Testing**: pytest in quiet mode with proper test discovery
- **CI**: GitHub Actions workflow for Python 3.11 with lint and test stages
- **Pre-commit**: Hooks for automatic formatting and linting before commits

## Code pointers (paths)
- Main package: `apex/`
  - Runtime interfaces: `apex/runtime/` (message.py, router_api.py, switch_api.py)
  - Config: `apex/config/defaults.py`
  - Controller: `apex/controller/bandit_api.py`
  - Integrations: `apex/integrations/` (mcp/, llm/)
- Tests: `tests/` (6 test files validating all components)
- CI: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- Docs: `docs/M0/`

## Tests run (exact commands)
```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"  # Install with dev dependencies
make fmt                 # Format code with black/isort
make lint               # Run linting checks
make test               # Run pytest suite
```

## Results
- ✅ All 6 tests passing
- ✅ Linting passes (ruff + black)
- ✅ Package installs correctly
- ✅ CI workflow configured
- ✅ Pre-commit hooks configured

## Artifacts
- `artifacts/.gitkeep` placeholder for future runtime artifacts

## Open Questions
None - M0 scaffold is complete and ready for runtime implementation in future milestones.

## Definition of Done (DoD)
- ✅ `make lint` passes
- ✅ `make test` passes
- ✅ Package structure follows spec exactly
- ✅ All protocol interfaces defined
- ✅ Message dataclass is mutable with correct fields
- ✅ CI workflow configured with artifact upload
- ✅ Documentation complete
